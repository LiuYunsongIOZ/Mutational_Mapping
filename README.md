# Mutational_Mapping(Molecular Biology)
Academic Project (Adaptive Evolution)

This is an academic project started by Dr. Liu Yunsong from Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciencies. Our main goal is to help researchers conduct research on adaptive evolution. We hope this tool will be helpful to you. This tool called "Mutaional Mapping" will mainly use Python to finish.
